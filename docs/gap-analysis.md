# Mnemosyne Gap Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: In Progress
**Phase**: Comprehensive Testing & Validation

## Critical Issues (P0) - System Broken

### P0-001: Keychain Storage Silently Fails on macOS ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: `src/config.rs` - ConfigManager
**Impact**: API key cannot be persisted, blocking production use
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commit a208881

**Description**:
The `ConfigManager::set_api_key()` method reports success ("API key securely stored in OS keychain") but the key was not actually persisted to the macOS Keychain. Immediate retrieval with `get_api_key()` failed with "No API key found in keychain".

**Root Cause**:
The keyring crate (v3.6.3) defaults to `MockCredential` (in-memory only) when platform-native features are not enabled. The Cargo.toml was missing platform-specific feature flags.

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
# Before:
keyring = "3.6.3"

# After:
keyring = { version = "3.6.3", features = ["apple-native", "windows-native", "linux-native"] }
```

Added verification logging in `src/config.rs` to immediately check storage after set.

**Verification**:
```bash
# Before fix:
DEBUG created entry MockCredential { ... }

# After fix:
DEBUG created entry MacCredential { domain: User, service: "mnemosyne-memory-system", account: "anthropic-api-key" }

$ cargo run -- config set-key "test-key"
✓ API key securely saved to OS keychain

$ cargo run -- config show-key
✓ API key configured: test-k...7890
  Source: OS keychain

$ security find-generic-password -s "mnemosyne-memory-system" -a "anthropic-api-key" -w
test-key
```

**Impact**: Users can now securely store API keys persistently across sessions without needing environment variables.

**Actual Effort**: 1 hour

## Major Issues (P1) - Feature Incomplete

### P1-001: Multi-Agent System Was Using Stub Implementations ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: P1 - Major Architectural Issue
**Component**: `src/orchestration/agents/*.py` - All 4 agents
**Impact**: Agents had no real intelligence, couldn't make decisions, no tool access
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commits 0335b1c through f2f5ded

**Description**:
All 4 agents (Orchestrator, Optimizer, Reviewer, Executor) were basic Python classes with hardcoded logic and no actual Claude Agent SDK integration. The agents could not:
- Make intelligent decisions
- Access tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Maintain conversation context
- Adapt to complex scenarios

**Root Cause**:
The `claude-agent-sdk` dependency was incorrectly removed when installation failed with Python 3.9. The package DOES exist but requires Python 3.10+. Instead of investigating the version requirement, the dependency was removed and agents were implemented as stubs.

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Restored Dependency** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.10"  # Was >=3.9
dependencies = [
    "claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0",  # Restored
    "rich>=13.0.0",
]
```

2. **Created Python 3.11 Environment**:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install claude-agent-sdk==0.1.5
```

3. **Refactored All 4 Agents** to use `ClaudeSDKClient`:
   - **ExecutorAgent**: Tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), permission mode `acceptEdits`
   - **OrchestratorAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob), permission mode `view`
   - **OptimizerAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob), permission mode `view`
   - **ReviewerAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob, Grep), permission mode `view`

4. **Added System Prompts** defining each agent's role and responsibilities

5. **Implemented Session Lifecycle** with async context managers

6. **Added Message Storage** in PyStorage for persistence

**Verification**:
```bash
# Unit tests (no API key required)
pytest tests/orchestration/test_integration.py -v -m "not integration"
# Result: 9/9 tests passing ✅

# Integration tests (requires API key export)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pytest tests/orchestration/test_integration.py -v -m integration
# Result: Ready for execution
```

**Impact**: The multi-agent system now has real intelligence and can make context-aware decisions. This is a fundamental architectural improvement.

**Related Documentation**:
- `docs/multi-agent-refactoring-summary.md` - Complete refactoring details
- `tests/orchestration/test_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `multi-agent-design-spec.md` - Updated architecture section

**Actual Effort**: 4 hours (investigation, refactoring all 4 agents, testing, documentation)

## Minor Issues (P2) - Polish/Optimization

### P2-001: E2E Test Scripts Incompatible with MCP Architecture

**Severity**: P2 - Test Infrastructure Issue
**Component**: `tests/e2e/human_workflow_*.sh`
**Impact**: E2E tests cannot execute, manual testing required
**Status**: ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Description**:
The E2E test scripts in `tests/e2e/` were designed to test CLI commands like `mnemosyne remember`, `mnemosyne search`, etc. However, the actual implementation uses an **MCP server** architecture where these operations are tools called via JSON-RPC, not CLI commands.

**Test Scripts Affected**:
- `human_workflow_1_new_project.sh` - Tests memory capture
- `human_workflow_2_discovery.sh` - Tests search and discovery
- `human_workflow_3_consolidation.sh` - Tests consolidation

**Actual CLI Commands Available**:
```
mnemosyne serve       # Start MCP server (stdio mode)
mnemosyne init        # Initialize database
mnemosyne export      # Export memories to Markdown
mnemosyne status      # Show system status
mnemosyne config      # Configuration management
mnemosyne orchestrate # Launch multi-agent orchestration
```

**MCP Tools (via server, not CLI)**:
- `mnemosyne.remember` - Store memory
- `mnemosyne.recall` - Search memories
- `mnemosyne.list` - List memories
- `mnemosyne.update` - Update memory
- `mnemosyne.delete` - Delete memory
- `mnemosyne.consolidate` - Consolidate duplicates

**Options for Resolution**:

1. **Option A**: Implement CLI wrappers for MCP tools
   - Add `mnemosyne remember`, `mnemosyne search` CLI commands
   - These would internally start MCP server, call tool, return result
   - **Effort**: ~4 hours
   - **Benefit**: E2E tests work as-is, improves CLI UX

2. **Option B**: Rewrite E2E tests to use MCP protocol
   - Convert shell scripts to Python tests using MCP client
   - Call tools via JSON-RPC
   - **Effort**: ~6 hours
   - **Benefit**: Tests actual deployment architecture

3. **Option C**: Defer E2E tests, rely on manual testing
   - **Effort**: 0 hours
   - **Risk**: Less automated validation

**Recommendation**: Option C (defer) for now, consider Option A in future sprint.

**Rationale**:
- LLM integration tests (Phase 1) already validate core functionality
- Multi-agent unit tests validate orchestration
- Manual testing sufficient for current phase
- CLI wrappers would improve UX beyond just testing

**Workaround for Manual Testing**:
```bash
# Start MCP server
./target/release/mnemosyne serve

# Use Claude Code with MCP integration to test
# Or use Python MCP client for manual validation
```

**Bugs Fixed in This Phase**:

1. **Invalid Permission Mode** (Commit 1864739)
   - Error: `option '--permission-mode <mode>' argument 'view' is invalid`
   - Fix: Changed permission mode from "view" to "default" in Orchestrator, Optimizer, and Reviewer agents
   - Files: `orchestrator.py`, `optimizer.py`, `reviewer.py`

2. **Invalid Namespace Format** (Commit 95d79d7/690c17d)
   - Error: `RuntimeError: Invalid namespace format: agent-test_optimizer`
   - Root Cause: PyStorage only accepts "global", "project:name", or "session:project:id" formats
   - Fix: Changed all agent namespaces from `f"agent-{agent_id}"` to `f"project:agent-{agent_id}"`
   - Files: All 4 agent files

3. **Database Schema Not Initialized** (Commit a2fcb55)
   - Error: `RuntimeError: Database error: (code: 1) no such table: memories`
   - Root Cause: `SqliteStorage::new()` wasn't running migrations automatically
   - Fix: Modified `src/storage/sqlite.rs` to auto-run migrations after pool creation
   - Impact: All test databases now have correct schema automatically

4. **Async/Await Type Mismatch** (Commit a3c1b1d)
   - Error: `TypeError: object str can't be used in 'await' expression`
   - Root Cause: `PyStorage.store()` is synchronous (uses `block_on` internally), not async
   - Fix: Removed `await` keyword from all `storage.store()` calls across all 4 agents
   - Files: All 4 agent files (8 call sites)

5. **KeyError 'completed_tasks'** (Commit 3bfb7eb)
   - Error: `KeyError: 'completed_tasks'` in E2E workflow tests
   - Root Cause: Engine tried to access dict keys unconditionally, but executor can return "challenged" status without these keys
   - Fix: Made stats printing conditional on `execution_result.get("status") == "success"`
   - File: `src/orchestration/engine.py`

**Key Findings**:
- Multi-agent system successfully integrated with Claude Agent SDK
- All 4 agents can create sessions, maintain context, and execute with real Claude API
- Agent tool permissions working correctly (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Session lifecycle management validated
- Quality gates operational with real LLM evaluation
- Skill discovery working with Claude analysis

**Commits**:
```
1864739 - Fix permission modes for Claude Agent SDK compatibility
95d79d7 - Fix namespace format for PyStorage compatibility
a2fcb55 - Fix: Auto-run database migrations in SqliteStorage::new
a3c1b1d - Fix: Remove await from synchronous storage.store() calls
