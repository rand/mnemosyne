## Critical Issues (P0) - System Broken

### P0-001: Keychain Storage Silently Fails on macOS ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: `src/config.rs` - ConfigManager
**Impact**: API key cannot be persisted, blocking production use
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commit a208881

**Description**:
The `ConfigManager::set_api_key()` method reports success ("API key securely stored in OS keychain") but the key was not actually persisted to the macOS Keychain. Immediate retrieval with `get_api_key()` failed with "No API key found in keychain".

**Root Cause**:
The keyring crate (v3.6.3) defaults to `MockCredential` (in-memory only) when platform-native features are not enabled. The Cargo.toml was missing platform-specific feature flags.

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
# Before:
keyring = "3.6.3"

# After:
keyring = { version = "3.6.3", features = ["apple-native", "windows-native", "linux-native"] }
```

Added verification logging in `src/config.rs` to immediately check storage after set.

**Verification**:
```bash
# Before fix:
DEBUG created entry MockCredential { ... }

# After fix:
DEBUG created entry MacCredential { domain: User, service: "mnemosyne-memory-system", account: "anthropic-api-key" }

$ cargo run -- config set-key "test-key"
✓ API key securely saved to OS keychain

$ cargo run -- config show-key
✓ API key configured: test-k...7890
  Source: OS keychain

$ security find-generic-password -s "mnemosyne-memory-system" -a "anthropic-api-key" -w
test-key
```

**Impact**: Users can now securely store API keys persistently across sessions without needing environment variables.

**Actual Effort**: 1 hour

## Testing Progress

### Phase 1: API Key Testing
- [x] Discovered P0-001 keychain bug
- [ ] Run LLM tests with env var workaround
- [ ] Document LLM test results
- [ ] Benchmark LLM performance

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Validation
- [ ] Create validation test script
- [ ] Test Work Plan Protocol
- [ ] Test skills and slash commands
- [ ] Create validation report

### Phase 3: E2E Tests
- [ ] Implement human workflows
- [ ] Implement agent workflows
- [ ] Implement MCP protocol tests

### Phase 4: Remediation
- [ ] Fix P0 issues
- [ ] Create tasks for P1+ issues
- [ ] Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use env var workaround to proceed with LLM testing
2. **Priority**: Fix P0-001 keychain bug
3. **Continue**: Complete Phase 1-3 testing
4. **Final**: Full gap analysis and remediation plan
