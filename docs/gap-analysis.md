## Critical Issues (P0) - System Broken

### P0-001: Keychain Storage Silently Fails on macOS ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: `src/config.rs` - ConfigManager
**Impact**: API key cannot be persisted, blocking production use
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commit a208881

**Description**:
The `ConfigManager::set_api_key()` method reports success ("API key securely stored in OS keychain") but the key was not actually persisted to the macOS Keychain. Immediate retrieval with `get_api_key()` failed with "No API key found in keychain".

**Root Cause**:
The keyring crate (v3.6.3) defaults to `MockCredential` (in-memory only) when platform-native features are not enabled. The Cargo.toml was missing platform-specific feature flags.

**Fix Applied**:
Updated `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
# Before:
keyring = "3.6.3"

# After:
keyring = { version = "3.6.3", features = ["apple-native", "windows-native", "linux-native"] }
```

Added verification logging in `src/config.rs` to immediately check storage after set.

**Verification**:
```bash
# Before fix:
DEBUG created entry MockCredential { ... }

# After fix:
DEBUG created entry MacCredential { domain: User, service: "mnemosyne-memory-system", account: "anthropic-api-key" }

$ cargo run -- config set-key "test-key"
✓ API key securely saved to OS keychain

$ cargo run -- config show-key
✓ API key configured: test-k...7890
  Source: OS keychain

$ security find-generic-password -s "mnemosyne-memory-system" -a "anthropic-api-key" -w
test-key
```

**Impact**: Users can now securely store API keys persistently across sessions without needing environment variables.

**Actual Effort**: 1 hour

## Major Issues (P1) - Feature Incomplete

### P1-001: Multi-Agent System Was Using Stub Implementations ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: P1 - Major Architectural Issue
**Component**: `src/orchestration/agents/*.py` - All 4 agents
**Impact**: Agents had no real intelligence, couldn't make decisions, no tool access
**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commits 0335b1c through f2f5ded

**Description**:
All 4 agents (Orchestrator, Optimizer, Reviewer, Executor) were basic Python classes with hardcoded logic and no actual Claude Agent SDK integration. The agents could not:
- Make intelligent decisions
- Access tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Maintain conversation context
- Adapt to complex scenarios

**Root Cause**:
The `claude-agent-sdk` dependency was incorrectly removed when installation failed with Python 3.9. The package DOES exist but requires Python 3.10+. Instead of investigating the version requirement, the dependency was removed and agents were implemented as stubs.

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Restored Dependency** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.10"  # Was >=3.9
dependencies = [
    "claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0",  # Restored
    "rich>=13.0.0",
]
```

2. **Created Python 3.11 Environment**:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install claude-agent-sdk==0.1.5
```

3. **Refactored All 4 Agents** to use `ClaudeSDKClient`:
   - **ExecutorAgent**: Tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), permission mode `acceptEdits`
   - **OrchestratorAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob), permission mode `view`
   - **OptimizerAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob), permission mode `view`
   - **ReviewerAgent**: Tools (Read, Glob, Grep), permission mode `view`

4. **Added System Prompts** defining each agent's role and responsibilities

5. **Implemented Session Lifecycle** with async context managers

6. **Added Message Storage** in PyStorage for persistence

**Verification**:
```bash
# Unit tests (no API key required)
pytest tests/orchestration/test_integration.py -v -m "not integration"
# Result: 9/9 tests passing ✅

# Integration tests (requires API key export)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pytest tests/orchestration/test_integration.py -v -m integration
# Result: Ready for execution
```

**Impact**: The multi-agent system now has real intelligence and can make context-aware decisions. This is a fundamental architectural improvement.

**Related Documentation**:
- `docs/multi-agent-refactoring-summary.md` - Complete refactoring details
- `tests/orchestration/test_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `multi-agent-design-spec.md` - Updated architecture section

**Actual Effort**: 4 hours (investigation, refactoring all 4 agents, testing, documentation)

## Testing Progress

### Phase 1: LLM Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Discovered P0-001 keychain bug
- [x] Fixed P0-001 keychain bug (platform-native features)
- [x] Optimized tests with shared LLM service instance
- [x] Run LLM tests - ALL 5 TESTS PASSING
- [x] Document LLM test results (docs/llm-test-results.md)
- [ ] Benchmark LLM performance (deferred - acceptable 2.6s/enrichment)

**Duration**: 2 hours (including bug fix)
**Key Findings**: All LLM integration working correctly, keychain storage fixed

---

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Validation ✅ STRUCTURAL VALIDATION COMPLETE
- [x] Create validation test script (tests/orchestration/multi-agent-validation.md)
- [x] Test Mnemosyne skills and slash commands (structural validation)
- [x] Create Phase 2 interim report (docs/phase-2-interim-report.md)
- [ ] Test Work Plan Protocol (requires user observation - deferred)
- [ ] Test agent coordination (requires runtime instrumentation - deferred)

## Next Steps

1. **User Decision Required**: Execute E2E tests now or defer?
   - Option A: Run tests now, document results, address findings
   - Option B: Defer test execution, finalize gap analysis with current knowledge

2. **Complete Phase 4**: Create final remediation plan based on findings

3. **Production Readiness Assessment**: Determine if current state is production-ready
