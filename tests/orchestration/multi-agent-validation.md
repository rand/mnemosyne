## Test Execution Plan

### Manual Test Protocol

1. **For each test**:
   - Document input clearly
   - Observe agent behavior
   - Record actual behavior in "Actual Behavior" section
   - Mark status (✅ Pass, ❌ Fail, ⚠️ Partial)
   - Note any deviations from expected behavior

2. **Failure handling**:
   - Document specific failure
   - Identify root cause (spec vs implementation)
   - Create issue in gap-analysis.md
   - Assign priority (P0-P3)

3. **Reporting**:
   - Summarize results in validation report
   - Create remediation plan for failures
   - Update CLAUDE.md if spec needs clarification

### Success Criteria

**Pass**: All expected behaviors observed, no critical deviations
**Partial**: Most behaviors observed, minor deviations noted
**Fail**: Expected behaviors not observed, critical issues found

## Results Summary

**Total Tests**: 23
**Passed**: 1 (Test 3.1)
**Partial**: 6 (Tests 3.2-3.7 - commands exist but require MCP server runtime testing)
**Not Run**: 16 (Tests 1.1-2.6, 4.1-5.3)

**Progress**:
- Part 1 (Work Plan Protocol): Not Run (requires user observation)
- Part 2 (Agent Coordination): Not Run (requires runtime testing)
- Part 3 (Mnemosyne Integration): Partially Complete
  - ✅ Skills discovery validated (Test 3.1)
  - ⚠️ Slash commands structurally validated, runtime testing pending (Tests 3.2-3.7)
- Part 4 (Anti-Pattern Detection): Not Run
- Part 5 (Edge Cases): Not Run

**Key Findings**:

✅ **Successes**:
1. Mnemosyne skill (`mnemosyne-context-preservation.md`) exists and is comprehensive (842 lines)
2. Six slash commands properly defined with:
   - YAML frontmatter
   - Usage documentation
   - Auto-namespace detection
   - MCP tool integration
   - Error handling
   - Formatted output specifications
3. Commands discovered: /memory-store, /memory-search, /memory-context, /memory-list, /memory-export, /memory-consolidate
4. Skills directory has 20+ skills across multiple domains (database, frontend, zig, discovery)

⚠️ **Limitations**:
1. Runtime testing requires MCP server (`mnemosyne serve`)
2. Work Plan Protocol testing requires manual observation of agent behavior
3. Agent coordination testing requires instrumentation or logging
4. Anti-pattern detection requires triggering specific scenarios

**Critical Issues Found**: None so far

**Overall Assessment**: ⏳ Phase 2 Partial Progress - Structural validation complete for Mnemosyne integration, runtime testing deferred to Phase 3 (E2E tests)

## Next Steps

After completing this validation:
1. Create comprehensive validation report (docs/multi-agent-validation-report.md)
2. Update gap-analysis.md with any issues found
3. Proceed to Phase 3: E2E Test Flows
