# Example: Store a Memory
#
# This example demonstrates how to store a memory with automatic LLM enrichment.
# The LLM will generate a summary, extract keywords, classify the type, and create tags.
#
# Usage:
#   ./store-memory.sh

set -e

  --content "Decided to use Redis for session storage instead of in-memory sessions.

             Rationale:
             - Need session persistence across server restarts
             - Plan to scale horizontally with multiple app servers
             - Redis provides fast access (< 1ms) and automatic expiration

             Trade-offs:
             - Added dependency (Redis server required)
             - Slightly slower than in-memory (negligible in practice)

             Configuration:
             - TTL: 24 hours
             - Connection pool: 10 connections
             - Fallback: Reject requests if Redis unavailable" \
