  - MemoryId, Namespace (Global/Project/Session)
  - MemoryType (9 classifications), LinkType (5 relationships)
  - MemoryNote with full metadata and importance decay
  - SearchQuery and SearchResult
  - Consolidation decisions
- [x] Comprehensive error handling (`error.rs`)
- [x] SQLite storage backend with FTS5
  - Full CRUD operations
  - FTS5 keyword search
  - Graph traversal with recursive CTE
  - Immutable audit logging
- [x] Database migrations (sqlx)
- [x] CLI framework with clap
- [x] All tests passing (27 tests)

---

## ✅ Phase 2: LLM Intelligence (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Add Claude Haiku integration for memory enrichment

**Completed**:
- [x] LLM service with Claude Haiku integration
- [x] Secure API key management (OS keychain)
  - macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service
  - Three-tier lookup: env var → keychain → interactive prompt
- [x] Note construction and enrichment
  - Auto-generate summary, keywords, tags
  - Classify memory type and importance
- [x] Semantic link generation
  - Detect relationships between memories
  - Assign link types and strengths
- [x] Consolidation decision logic
  - Merge similar memories
  - Supersede outdated information
  - Keep distinct content separate
- [x] Hybrid search implementation (keyword + graph)
  - FTS5 keyword search as seed
  - Graph expansion (2 hops from top seeds)
  - Weighted ranking: 50% keyword, 20% graph, 20% importance, 10% recency
