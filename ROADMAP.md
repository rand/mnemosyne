## ‚úÖ Phase 2: LLM Intelligence (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Add Claude Haiku integration for memory enrichment

**Completed**:

  - Auto-generate summary, keywords, tags
  - Classify memory type and importance
- [x] Semantic link generation
  - Detect relationships between memories
  - Assign link types and strengths
- [x] Consolidation decision logic
  - Merge similar memories
  - Supersede outdated information
  - Keep distinct content separate
- [x] Hybrid search implementation (keyword + graph)
  - FTS5 keyword search as seed

## üî® Phase 6: Multi-Agent Orchestration (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Implement the 4-agent architecture from CLAUDE.md

  - `src/orchestration/parallel_executor.py` - Concurrent task execution
  - `src/orchestration/context_monitor.py` - Low-latency monitoring

Claude Agent SDK (Python)
    ‚Üì
mnemosyne_core (PyO3 bindings)
    ‚Üì
Mnemosyne Storage (Rust)
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Storage operations: <1ms (vs 20-50ms subprocess)
- Context monitoring: 10ms polling (vs 100ms minimum)
